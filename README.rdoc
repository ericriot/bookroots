== README

BookRoots serves several purposes:

* Store references that books make to other books, authors, artists, music etc.

* Help people find books to read.

* Serve as Eric's dev playground to learn new technologies such as:
  * Ruby on Rails
  * MongoDb
  * AngularJS
  * CoffeeScript

This is not supposed to compete with GoodReads. It aims to compliment it. If I could turn this into a money making venture that'd be great, but that is not the goal.
